# 3D Rendering Example Using WebGI and Gsap

https://github.com/bhaskarshukla002/3D-Rendering-example-Using-WebGI-and-Gsap/assets/86822762/b22f8e15-1f86-4d64-8649-29004cffe578

This project is a simple example of how to use WebGI and Gsap to create a 3D rendering of a scene with animations and interactions.

WebGI is a JavaScript library that provides a high-level API for WebGL, the web standard for 3D graphics. It allows you to create 3D scenes with meshes, materials, lights, cameras, and more.

Gsap is a JavaScript library that provides a powerful and easy-to-use animation engine. It allows you to create animations with tweens, timelines, easing, and more.

```
## Usage
To interact with the 3D scene, you can use the following controls:

Use the mouse to rotate the camera around the scene.
Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the scene.
Click on the objects to trigger animations and sounds.
You can also use the GUI panel on the top right corner to adjust some parameters of the scene, such as the background color, the ambient light intensity, and the fog density.
